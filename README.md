# Consistency.com 🎯

**The habit tracker that doesn't hate you.** Built for humans who want to build better habits without drowning in feature bloat.

## What is this?

Remember when apps were simple? Consistency.com is a monthly habit tracker that cuts through the noise. Track your daily habits with a clean grid view, add some personality with emojis, and switch between light/dark themes. That's it. No gamification that burns you out, no premium walls that lock basic features.

Just you, your habits, and a beautifully minimal interface that adapts perfectly to your phone and desktop.

> 🚧 **Work in Progress** — This is actively being built with passion and purpose. Each feature is carefully crafted, not rushed. Quality over quantity, always.

## 🎭 Philosophy

Every other habit tracker is bloated with features you don't need. Premium subscriptions for basic functionality. Guilt-inducing streaks. Overwhelming dashboards.

This app is different. It's built on the belief that **consistency beats perfection**, and **simplicity beats complexity**.

No BS. No bloat. Just a clean, fast, beautiful way to track your habits.


*Built with ❤️ by a solo developer who believes in the power of small, daily actions.*
